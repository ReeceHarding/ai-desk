From surfing to kite surfing to wondrous waterfalls, prepare for one of the craziest weeks of your life. Explore below to discover six of our favorite day trips that you can easily access right from Las Canas! To book the following activities for your stay, please contact us at info@lascanasbeachretreat.com Surfing at Playa Encuentro While we highly suggest surfing at Las Canas. If you’re a true surf lover we also highly recommend checking out Playa Encuentro. With reliable waves, calm waters and friendly instructors, it’s for good reason many refer to Encuentro as ’surfer beach’. Encuentro is ideal for beginners and is getting discovered by professionals as well. In fact, Encuentro was even the proud host of the famous World Surf League, the first time it was ever hosted in the Dominican Republic! Even though Encuentro is known by many locals and surfers alike, it remains a very quiet and unspoilt beach. It is a true hidden gem. Riding your first waves ever or for the first time in a long time? It’s your lucky day – Encuentro is dotted with many professional surf schools that are eager to get you on the board and enjoy this amazing watersport. Kite Surfing (and windsurfing!) Cabarete is the world-class kitesurfing hotspot of the Dominican and one of the best places to (learn how to) kitesurf worldwide. Cabarete’s kite beach is a favorite spot amongst locals and internationals alike. The beach’s proximity to a flat reef results in calm water on the inside and strong waves breaking on the reef 200m away from shore. This makes it an ideal learning spot for beginners with certified kitesurfing schools found all along the beach. As for the more experienced kite-a-holics, a thrilling ride downwinder towards Bozo or Encuentro Beach awaits. Whatever time of year, the Dominican’s world class year-round wind enables kite – and windsurfing – in every season. No matter the season you’ll be sure to have perfect conditions to go out and try it yourself! Waterfall Hike For nature lovers, this hike is a must-do! Located just minutes from Las Canas, the convenience of this adventure can’t be beat. Let our very own tour guide Rupert show you all the natural beauty the Dominican has to offer. (Make sure to bring water shoes as we’ll be crossing rivers and streams along the way) After a blood pumping trek through the rain forest you’ll get to the crown jewel: a beautiful waterfall, tucked away from everything, just calling your name. Cool off with a quick dip in the pool and then finish your journey off with a picturesque view of the surrounding valley. As a reward on the way back, you might be lucky enough to come across a ripe cacao tree. There’s nothing better than succulent cacao meat (yum!) Horseback Riding Always played with the idea of riding a horse but never really got to it? Or an experienced rider who just can’t get enough? This is THE opportunity to get (back) into it! Get a private tour at Luisa &amp; Tommy’s ranch and jump on one of their well-cared for horses. Completely tailored to your personal pace, preferred duration and what you want to experience. Prefer to ride on the beach? No problemo. Prefer the waterfall? Let’s include that as well. Perfectly tailored to your preferences, both experienced riders and first-timers will all be able to enjoy an amazing adventure! After meeting Tommy, getting on your new big friend and obtaining some instructions, you will head out for a ride through the lush mountainous landscape. Here, you’ll pass farms, ride through rivers, past small local villages and through pristine lands where it’s just you, your horse and the birds. Getting exhausted and longing for a break? Stop at the lake or one of the many rivers, and recharge by taking a well-deserved dip in the water. Upon your return at the rancho, the adventure is not over yet. Get ready to dive into a fresh and delicious Dominican style lunch made especially for you. Here, you can talk over everything you’ve seen during your ride and what you’ve missed by being busy holding your horses. This is also the perfect opportunity to interrogate Tommy a bit more on all his horses and the Dominican Nature. SUP (Stand Up Paddleboarding) A recent trend that we are sure is here to stay: supping! Short for stand up paddling, this sports involves just a special board and a paddle. The goal is to stand up and paddle your way along the waters. Do get ready for some good laughs, as standing up and keep standing is initially not quite as easy as it looks. Once everyone gets the hang of it, supping will be the perfect activity to navigate and enjoy the beauties of the island, while having some good fun on the water. Luckily, at Las Canas, we just happen to offer private paddle boarding tours for our guests to experience this activity and explore our nearby, unspoiled mangroves and lagoon! Just bring your swimsuit and waterproof camera, and we’ll take care of all the rest. Snorkeling and Scuba Diving Above water, there’s a lot to do, but it wouldn’t be the Caribbean without an entire underwater world waiting for you to explore! Just a quick 30-minute drive from Las Canas, Sosúa Bay is the ultimate spot to kick off your ocean adventures. For a laid-back but unforgettable experience, grab some snorkel gear and drift along the surface, taking in vibrant coral gardens and bustling marine life just below. It’s perfect if you want to explore without diving deep. Or, if you’re up for more, head to one of the many PADI-certified dive schools to plan your dive—whether you’re a beginner looking for an intro dive with an instructor or an experienced diver ready to explore coral walls, mysterious caves, and even shipwrecks! 27 Waterfalls of Damajagua Last but most definitely not least: navigate your way right through the canyon-like river of Damajagua and experience some real thrills by jumping and sliding down its (27!) waterfalls. The tour starts at the base camp where you’ll be provided with the full safety equipment. Bring your own water shoes, or rent or buy them at base. Upon leaving camp, each group gets assigned a local guide, who navigates, helps out wherever possible and points out how to approach each waterfall. You’ll get to choose whether to do 7 waterfalls, which takes about 90 minutes, or to do all 27, taking about 2-3 hours. What follows is a short hike through the local nature, with the guide and small signs explaining the special plants and trees along the trail. The hike ends at the start of either the 7 or 27 waterfalls, depending on your preference, and from then on you’ll enter the water, only to swim, slide, and jump all the way down the waterfalls! Making your way through a canyon-style river in the middle of the jungle, with the highest waterfalls being 5 to 8 meters high right at the end, you are definitely in for a thrill! In case some anxiety crawls up just as you want to make your jumps, there is always the option to take a natural rock slide or ladder down. Get some proof of overcoming all your fears by hiring a local guy to take your pictures and videos while you focus on the fun and thrills, or hand your camera over to your local guide.

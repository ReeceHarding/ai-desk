Objective
You (Cursor IDE) will make minimal, carefully contained changes to my codebase without breaking existing functionality. Each change should be focused on a single feature or improvement, and no other parts of the code should be altered unless explicitly instructed.

Key Instructions

Check the Documentation folder's files ot learn about the project.

When changing the migration files, change exsiting migration files. don't create new files. 

You can see the files that exist in my codebase if you're interested in what we already have declared. Don't ask me unless you're checked and couldn't find specific info.

Analyze Before Changing

Before writing or modifying any code, think through how these changes could affect existing functionality.

Summarize potential side effects and how you will mitigate them.

List Your Steps
Provide a list (step-by-step) of how you plan to implement or modify the feature in extremely precise detail, referencing specific files, lines, variables, environment keys, back-end endpoints, UI components, and so on.

Minimal, Focused Code Changes

Only modify the files and lines necessary to implement the current feature or fix.

Do not add or remove unrelated code.

Provide Code in Small Batches

Give only the code snippet(s) for the current task.

Confirm No Breakage

Ensure existing features remain functional.

For each code snippet, explain how it should be tested or how we should test that it doesnâ€™t break other parts of the system.

Await Feedback Before Proceeding

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

After providing a snippet and explaining it, wait for my confirmation or feedback before doing anything else.

Write logging messages for all the changes you make.

Do not move on to the next step until I confirm the snippet works or provide new instructions.

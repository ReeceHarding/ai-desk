1.  **Setup Environment**

    *   Install Node.js (v18) and Python (v3.10) on development systems. This aligns with the backend requirements for scripting and development (as per **Tech Stack: Dependencies**).
    *   Set up development environment using Cursor IDE for AI-powered coding assistance, leveraging its real-time suggestions feature (referenced in **Q&A: Selected Tools**).
    *   Initialize a new Git repository for version control, establish branch protection rules to ensure code quality and manage releases (following **PRD: Version Control**).
    *   Create Docker containers for PostgreSQL to utilize JSONB fields and TRGM/vector embeddings. Also configure Redis for caching, both specified in the **Tech Stack: Infrastructure** section.

2.  **Develop Core Features**

    *   Implement a user authentication system with Firebase Auth, incorporating multi-tenancy and role-based access control with roles defined as 'customer', 'agent', 'admin', and 'super_admin' (details in **PRD: Authentication**).
    *   Integrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for AI-driven autoresponder and chatbot capabilities as outlined in the **PRD: AI Autoresponder & Chatbot**.
    *   Develop the ticket management module allowing users to create, assign, and track tickets. Implement SLA tracking for automatic status updates (e.g., overdue) based on `due_at` timestamps, as prescribed in **PRD: Ticket Management**.
    *   Build the knowledge base management feature with version control and localization support, enabling users to manage public or internal articles (refer to **PRD: Knowledge Base Management**).

3.  **Frontend Development**

    *   Use a modern JavaScript framework, likely React, to build the frontend UI, applying the dark-themed aesthetic inspired by modern dashboards such as Slack dark mode and Intercom Inbox. Ensure it is responsive as per **PRD: Design Preferences**.
    *   Translate Figma wireframes into UI components with a focus on usability, clean sans-serif typography, and minimalistic design as specified in **App Flow: UI Design**.
    *   Implement client-side routing to allow seamless navigation between different views: tickets, dashboard, and knowledge base articles (specified in **PRD: Core Features**).

4.  **Testing & Validation**

    *   Utilize Jest for unit testing to ensure each module functions correctly, especially focusing on the API endpoints and authentication processes. This aligns with **Tech Stack: Testing Tools**.
    *   Perform load testing using Postman collections to validate system behavior under high traffic conditions, as emphasized in **PRD: Performance**.
    *   Ensure compliance with GDPR through script validations that check for data handling as required by **Q&A: Compliance**.

5.  **Deployment**

    *   Deploy backend services on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and reliability, utilizing AWS RDS for database operations as stated in **Tech Stack: Deployment**.
    *   Host frontend assets on AWS S3 with CloudFront for content delivery, ensuring fast and scalable delivery in accordance with **PRD: Non-Functional Requirements**.
    *   Configure logging and monitoring with AWS CloudWatch to track application performance and detect issues early as outlined in **Tech Stack: Monitoring**.

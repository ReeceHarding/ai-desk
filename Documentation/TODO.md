# Zendesk Clone Implementation TODO List

Goal:

let's adjust hte sign up flow. before showing the sign up screen, i want to ask the okay so before we start the sign up flow i want to add another screen that is our root path so we'll have a landing page and on the landing page it'll say are you a like do you have a question are you an agent or do you want to start your own organization then once they click one of those if they click agent we'll bring we'll bring them to the sign up page but we'll change the sign up page and we'll show an additional field this additional field will say what is the name of the company that you work for this sign up field as you start typing in it it'll automatically start filling in it'll show all the organizations at first with an autofill pop-up like google autofill search does and then it you type the number of choices will get whittled down based on a sub string search and then once you click the company word for it'll fill in the company's name and we will and then they'll fill in their email and password once they do that um then they will be directed to our dashboard screen similarly for admins if they click i'm an admin admin it'll say the same signup page but this time it'll be what company do you work for um once they click the company that they or sorry what is the name of your company they'll type in the name of their company they'll type in their email password then we'll create an organization assign them to that organization and then move on to the dashboard i forgot to mention that if they say that they are an agent we will assign them to the company they say they work for after they do the sign up page so once they click sign up we'll keep the same functionality creating the profile creating the authentication and then we'll also create an organization and assign the user to that organization and bind the two there can you create a step-by-step guide of the steps we should take in order to accomplish this including like designing the landing page and changing everything

Overview

Below are step-by-step instructions for our junior development team to make the entire Zendesk clone site fully mobile-compatible. The goal is to ensure that all pages, layouts, and components display cleanly on small screens, function properly on mobile devices, and look “production-ready” without visual overlap or misalignment. The instructions reference specific code blocks and files from within our project’s folder structure (as seen above). They will walk you through each relevant section, highlight the changes required, and indicate how to test that each change is successful. The instructions are cumulative, and you should follow them in the given order, stopping at each checkpoint to test the changes thoroughly before moving on.

Below is the plan:
	1.	Enable responsive breakpoints and minor utility classes
	2.	Refactor all layout files (particularly AppLayout, Sidebar), ensuring mobile compatibility
	3.	Update main pages (/tickets, /tickets/[id], /dashboard, etc.) with appropriate breakpoints
	4.	Ensure the hamburger menu overlays all content
	5.	Tighten spacing in ticket previews
	6.	Improve or unify usage of small screen spacing with p-, mx-, my-, gap-, and flex classes
	7.	Provide thorough tests at each checkpoint

Follow these instructions strictly and stop at the indicated checkpoints to verify that everything compiles and appears correct on a mobile device or emulator.

1. Enable Responsive Breakpoints and Minor Utility Classes

Step 1A: Open styles/globals.css (or whichever global tailwind config file we use). Make sure the following are present or look correct:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Any global resets or additional custom classes can go below */

Step 1B: Confirm that tailwind.config.js includes standard screen breakpoints at least for sm, md, lg, xl, and 2xl. For example:

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      sm: '640px',
      md: '768px',
      lg: '1024px',
      xl: '1280px',
      '2xl': '1536px',
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}

We want to ensure that default Tailwind breakpoints exist so that we can do things like md:hidden, lg:grid, etc. to adapt layouts to smaller screens. If these breakpoints are missing, add them.

Checkpoint 1: Stop here and test if your app still compiles without errors. Simply run your dev server, ensure no compilation errors. No visual changes should appear yet.

2. Refactor Layout Files to Ensure Mobile Compatibility

We have multiple layout-related files, such as:
	•	components/layout/AppLayout.tsx
	•	components/layout/Sidebar.tsx

Step 2A: In AppLayout.tsx, ensure we wrap everything in a container that can scale well. Notice that we do have a main region and a sidebar. We must confirm that on small screens, the sidebar disappears or becomes hidden behind the hamburger menu (which we already appear to do, but we must fix any spacing/overlap). Let’s systematically tweak classes:
	1.	Look for the parent container. We see:

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
  {/* Header */}
  <header className="fixed top-0 z-30 w-full bg-white border-b border-gray-200 shadow-sm">
    ...
  </header>
  <div className="flex h-screen pt-14 sm:pt-16">
    ...
  </div>
  <Toaster />
</div>

We want the content to be flexible. Confirm that on very small screens, we do not fix a wide width. Also, confirm the h-screen usage is correct. Because it can cause mobile scrolling issues sometimes, we might prefer min-h-screen or using some overflow-auto. If the page cannot scroll on small devices, switch to min-h-screen and overflow-y-auto in the main content area. For example:

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
  <header className="fixed top-0 z-30 w-full bg-white border-b border-gray-200 shadow-sm">
    ...
  </header>
  {/* Change from 'flex h-screen' to something allowing scrolling */}
  <div className="flex min-h-screen pt-14 sm:pt-16 overflow-hidden md:overflow-visible">
    ...
  </div>
  <Toaster />
</div>

The overflow-hidden can be toggled if we want to hide the sidebar on smaller devices, but we still might prefer overflow-x-hidden and let overflow-y-auto remain. Make sure your thread panel is not extending beyond the screen horizontally.

	2.	In the <main> region, see if we can reduce the fixed widths or set w-full. If the code looks like:

<main
  className={`flex-1 relative overflow-y-auto focus:outline-none
    ${isMobileMenuOpen ? 'md:ml-64' : ''}
    ${isThreadPanelOpen ? 'mr-[400px]' : ''}
    ...
>
  ...
</main>

We keep the logic, but ensure smaller breakpoints. For instance:
	•	mr-[400px] might break smaller devices. We can do: hidden sm:block sm:mr-[400px].
	•	Or let’s do: mr-0 sm:mr-[400px].
	•	Similarly for ml-64, we can do hidden md:block md:ml-64.

Step 2B: In Sidebar.tsx, verify the classes controlling the mobile menu. The user said the hamburger menu is in place, but half the page is “not visible” on small screens. Let’s ensure we add:
	•	For the container that currently says w-72 md:w-64, we want it to be hidden on small breakpoints unless the hamburger is toggled. We can do:

<div
  className={`fixed inset-y-0 left-0 transform ${
    isMobileMenuOpen ? 'translate-x-0' : '-translate-x-full'
  } md:relative md:translate-x-0 transition duration-200 ease-in-out z-40 bg-white w-64 top-14 sm:top-16 border-r border-gray-200 shadow-lg md:shadow-none`}
>
...
</div>


	•	Confirm that the hamburger icon in the header is absolutely top-left on mobile, so it is easy to see. Possibly, ensure z-50 is on that hamburger to overlay the main content.

Checkpoint 2: Now test on a very small screen or iPhone emulator. Confirm that you can open the hamburger menu, see the sidebar appear over everything else, close it, and that you can still scroll the main content. If anything is clipped, add overflow-y-auto or overflow-x-hidden. Confirm no compile errors and that the site runs.

3. Update Main Pages with Proper Breakpoints

We have main pages that appear to have layout issues:
	1.	pages/tickets/index.tsx (the ticket listing)
	2.	pages/tickets/[id].tsx (the individual ticket view)
	3.	pages/dashboard.tsx, possibly
	4.	Others like pages/auth/* are typically simpler.

Step 3A: For /tickets/index.tsx:
	•	We see a large table. On mobile, a table is often too wide. We can:
	•	Convert it into a stacked layout on sm: breakpoints or add overflow-x-auto. For example, wrap the table:

<div className="w-full overflow-x-auto">
  <table className="w-full text-sm text-slate-300">
    ...
  </table>
</div>


	•	Ensure flex, flex-col, or grid approach on small screens.

	•	The header has a search bar, a filter button, etc. On small screens, these might wrap onto multiple lines. That is fine. Just ensure correct space-y-2 sm:space-y-0 or gap-4.
	•	The user reported the “ticket preview is ugly on mobile.” Fix by ensuring each <tr> or card-like row has p-2 sm:p-4, or if we have repeated columns, consider making each row a block for mobile. For instance:

<tr className="group border-b border-slate-800 hover:bg-slate-800/50 transition-colors">
  <td className="py-3 px-2 text-sm sm:px-4"> ... </td>
  ...
</tr>

That can help spacing. Also, maybe we do not want 10 columns on mobile. We can hide certain columns with hidden md:table-cell.

Step 3B: For /tickets/[id].tsx:
	•	The user complained that “Half the page isn’t even visible.” Usually means an absolutely positioned side panel might be pushing content. We see the TicketInterface calls EmailThreadPanel with width [600px]. On mobile, we can do sm:w-[600px], else w-full. Possibly we do:

<motion.div
  initial={{ x: "100%" }}
  animate={{ x: 0 }}
  exit={{ x: "100%" }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 }}
  className="absolute top-0 right-0 w-full sm:w-[600px] h-full bg-white border-l border-gray-200 flex flex-col z-50"
>

Then test the styling on small devices. This ensures it doesn’t push the main content horizontally on mobile.

	•	Similarly, the ticket conversation area might have a wide layout or the details panel. Ensure the details panel is hidden or forced to full width on small devices. For example, if the TicketDetailsPanel is set at lg:col-span-1, you can do something like:

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
  <div className="lg:col-span-2">
    ...
  </div>
  <div className="lg:col-span-1 hidden lg:block">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

That way, on smaller screens, the details panel is hidden or placed at the bottom.

Checkpoint 3: Test each page on an actual mobile emulator. Confirm the table or list layout for tickets is readable, the detail page does not overflow horizontally. Adjust classes like p-4, space-y-2, flex-col as needed. Commit changes if all is well.

4. Ensure the Hamburger Menu Overlays All Content

Step 4A: In AppLayout.tsx or wherever we define the hamburger menu (the “mobile menu button”), ensure we have:

<button
  type="button"
  className="md:hidden inline-flex items-center justify-center p-2 -ml-1 rounded-md text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-100 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-inset focus:ring-blue-500 z-50"
  ...
>
  ...
</button>

We add z-50 so that it’s always above the content.

Step 4B: In the Sidebar.tsx or the parent container of the slide-out menu, also ensure z-40 or higher if needed. This is so the sidebar is on top but not overshadowing the hamburger button if the button is intentionally above. If the button is behind the panel, reduce the panel’s z-index to z-30 or so. Make sure the panel is still above the main content.

Checkpoint 4: On a small device, confirm that clicking the hamburger toggles the menu sliding from the left. Confirm that it never goes behind any other element. If it does, raise or lower the z- classes accordingly.

5. Tighten Spacing in Ticket Previews

Step 5A: The user specifically says “The preview of the ticket is crunched on top of each other, not spaced correctly.” For the code in inbox-interface.tsx (or pages/tickets/index.tsx, whichever is truly rendering these previews), we see a <table> or set of <div> elements. We want each “row” to have enough spacing.

We can do something like:

<div className="flex flex-col space-y-2 p-3 border-b border-gray-200">
  <div className="text-base font-semibold text-gray-900">Ticket Subject</div>
  <div className="text-sm text-gray-500">Ticket snippet or details</div>
</div>

Or if we’re using <tr>, apply something like p-3, space-y-1, etc. The key is that on mobile, we treat each row as a block:

<tr className="block w-full border-b border-slate-200 sm:table-row hover:bg-slate-50">
  <td className="block sm:table-cell p-3">
    ...
  </td>
  ...
</tr>

Checkpoint 5: Test again. The “ugly and malformed” is typically because of no spacing or no responsive classes. Confirm the items stack nicely. If the user’s name, subject, status, etc. are too wide, we can do overflow-ellipsis whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden on certain columns, or hide certain columns at small breakpoints with hidden sm:table-cell.

6. Improve or Unify Usage of Small Screen Spacing

Step 6A: For consistency, check the pages pages/dashboard.tsx and pages/profile/*.tsx or any other page. We want each to have consistent margin, e.g. p-4 on the container, maybe mx-auto for max-w on certain breakpoints. If the card or content is visually cut off, add max-w-... classes or w-full.

Step 6B: Test the conversation panel: if you see text overlapping edges, add p-4 or sm:p-6. Confirm that the EmailComposer (which uses Quill) is not pushing the screen horizontally. If it is, then we reduce the Quill container’s min-width, or we do w-full overflow-hidden.

Checkpoint 6: Verify that all pages you’ve tested so far do not horizontally scroll. If they do, identify which element is forcing the overflow. Possibly the new [600px] wide panels on small screens. Adjust them to sm:w-[600px] w-full. If the entire screen is horizontally scrollable but you can’t find the culprit, add border classes to suspected elements to see which is too big. Once done, commit your changes and re-test.

7. Provide Thorough Tests and Confirm All Is Production-Ready

Step 7A: Write small test scripts (like unit tests or small screen emulation tests) for each updated function or layout. For example:
	•	Testing the “hamburger menu toggles correctly”
	•	Testing “sidebar transitions in and out with no horizontal scroll”
	•	Testing “tickets listing does not horizontally scroll on iPhone 12 resolution”
	•	Testing “ticket detail panel is accessible, no hidden content off-screen”

Step 7B: Confirm final code compiles, run npm run dev or npm run build && npm run start, load from local mobile device or emulator. Everything should be fully functional and neatly spaced. If anything is still off, systematically look at breakpoints (like hidden md:block or p-2 sm:p-4).

Conclusion

This series of steps details exactly how to ensure each layout or page is mobile-friendly, with clear instructions for spacing, breakpoints, and potential pitfalls regarding side panels or overflow. After following these steps and verifying functionality at each checkpoint, the site should be fully responsive, well-organized, and visually appealing on small screen devices.

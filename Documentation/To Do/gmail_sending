 1. Database Updates in Supabase

### 1.1 Create a New Table: `ticket_email_chats`

1. In your **`/supabase/migrations`** folder, create a new migration file named, for example, `20250201120000_create_ticket_email_chats.sql` (replace the timestamp with the current date/time).
2. Open this new file. Define a new table **`ticket_email_chats`**. Make sure no existing tables or columns are altered or removed. For instance:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE public.ticket_email_chats (
     id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
     ticket_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.tickets (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     message_id text,         -- Unique Gmail message ID
     thread_id text,          -- Gmail thread ID
     from_address text,
     to_address text[],
     cc_address text[],
     bcc_address text[],
     subject text,
     body text,               -- Store the HTML or plain text of the email
     attachments jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
     gmail_date timestamptz,
     created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
   );
   ```

3. Create an index for efficient lookups:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX ticket_email_chats_ticket_idx
     ON public.ticket_email_chats (ticket_id);
   ```
4. Save and close the migration file.  
5. Run the migration in a development or staging environment to ensure it creates the table successfully. Confirm no existing code or references break due to this addition.

## 2. Right-Side Sliding Panel for the Email Conversation

### 2.1 Identifying the Location for the Panel
1. Find where tickets are displayed or where a user can click to see ticket details. For example:
   - A dedicated page: `pages/tickets/[id].tsx`
   - A component like `<TicketInterface>` or `<InboxInterface>` with a conversation area.

2. Decide where to trigger a **right-side sliding panel**. For instance, you can add a button or clickable section next to each ticket that sets a state variable, such as `setIsOpen(true)`, and stores the relevant `ticketId` or “conversation ID.”

### 2.2 Creating the Sliding Panel
1. Create a new React component, for example, **`<EmailThreadPanel />`**.  
2. Include a state or prop, e.g. `isOpen: boolean; ticketId: string;`, to control:
   - Whether it’s visible.
   - Which ticket’s email thread to load.
3. Use Framer Motion or your existing CSS transitions to animate the panel sliding in from the right. For example:
   ```tsx
   <motion.div
     initial={{ x: '100%' }}
     animate={{ x: 0 }}
     exit={{ x: '100%' }}
   >
     {/* Panel content */}
   </motion.div>
   ```
4. Within the panel, display the conversation fetched from your new `ticket_email_chats` table.

## 3. Retrieving and Displaying Emails in a Chat Format

### 3.1 Fetching Email Messages from `ticket_email_chats`
1. Inside your `<EmailThreadPanel>` component, when `ticketId` changes (or on component mount if it already knows the ticket ID), run a data-fetching function:
   ```js
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from('ticket_email_chats')
     .select('*')
     .eq('ticket_id', ticketId)
     .order('gmail_date', { ascending: true }); // or any other order you prefer
   ```
2. Store the returned email messages in a local state (e.g., `const [messages, setMessages] = useState([])`).

### 3.2 Infinite Scrolling for Large Conversations
1. If you anticipate many emails, implement pagination or infinite scroll. For example:
   - Start by fetching the newest 20 emails (descending by date).
   - If the user scrolls up, load older messages in batches of 20.
2. Keep track of the “oldest loaded message” or use a simple offset. For example, you can do:
   ```js
   const { data } = await supabase
     .from('ticket_email_chats')
     .select('*')
     .eq('ticket_id', ticketId)
     .order('gmail_date', { ascending: false })
     .range(offset, offset + 19);
   ```
3. Update your `messages` array accordingly each time you load more data.

4. Ensure that the conversation is rendered in a visually clear way, resembling a chat feed, with timestamps, `from_address`, etc.

## 4. Composing New Emails with Rich Text and Attachments

### 4.1 Adding a Rich-Text Editor
1. Choose a library (e.g., [Quill](https://quilljs.com/), [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/), or similar).
2. Create a subcomponent, for example, **`<EmailComposer>`**. This subcomponent might:
   - Provide a toolbar with **bold, italic, underline, bullet list, text color** options (based on your library’s default).
   - Render a text area or WYSIWYG editor area for the body of the email.

### 4.2 Handling Attachments
1. Include a button or icon (paperclip) in the `<EmailComposer>` for selecting files.  
2. On file selection, either:
   - Upload to Supabase Storage (in an “attachments” bucket), store the returned public URL in a local array of attachments, or
   - Prepare a direct approach for embedding attachments in the raw MIME data for Gmail.
3. If you store them in Supabase, you can also keep references in the `attachments` column of `ticket_email_chats`.

## 5. Sending Emails via Gmail

### 5.1 Building the “Send” Logic
1. On “Send,” gather relevant info from the editor (HTML content, attachments, subject) and any needed addresses (`from`, `to`, etc.).  
2. If you have an existing Gmail helper function (like `sendEmailMessage()`), expand it to accept:
   - **subject**: string
   - **body**: HTML string
   - **attachments**: array of file references if needed
   - **thread_id**: used if replying to a pre-existing conversation
   - **from**: if multiple addresses are used
   - **to**: typically the ticket’s customer or whichever address is relevant

3. Use the Gmail API endpoint `gmail.users.messages.send` (or a direct MIME approach) to create and send the message. If replying, attach the existing `thread_id`.

### 5.2 Saving Outgoing Messages Locally
1. After Gmail returns successfully, insert a row into **`ticket_email_chats`** with:
   ```js
   await supabase.from('ticket_email_chats').insert({
     ticket_id: ticketId,
     message_id: responseFromGmail.data.id, // or whichever ID is returned
     thread_id: existingThreadId,
     from_address: chosenFromAddress,
     to_address: [customerEmail],
     subject,
     body: htmlBody,
     attachments: JSON.stringify(attachments), // or a direct object if your library supports it
     gmail_date: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```
2. Immediately add this new message to your `messages` array in `<EmailThreadPanel>` so the user sees it appended in real time.

## 6. Receiving and Syncing Incoming Emails

### 6.1 Determining Polling vs. Push Notifications
1. If you already have a Gmail watch webhook in place (for real-time notifications), confirm it’s fully functional. Otherwise, keep or implement a short interval poll (e.g., every 1–2 minutes) to fetch new Gmail messages.  
2. Each time new messages are discovered from Gmail, parse them, confirm the relevant `ticket_id`, and insert them into `ticket_email_chats` with the correct fields. For attachments, either store them in Supabase or build references as needed.

### 6.2 Matching Messages to Tickets
1. Ensure each incoming email can be mapped to a particular `ticket_id`. Common approaches:
   - The “thread_id” from Gmail might be stored in the `tickets` table or derived from the user’s existing logic.
   - Some code might store a custom reference in the email subject (like a ticket number) for matching.
2. Once the correct `ticket_id` is found, insert a row into `ticket_email_chats`.

3. The `<EmailThreadPanel>` will show these new messages once the user reopens or if your code automatically refreshes the conversation in real time.

---

## 7. Handling Multiple Addresses per Organization

1. If an organization can have multiple addresses (e.g., `support@domain.com`, `sales@domain.com`), store each address and its OAuth tokens (if separate) in whichever table or structure you prefer.
2. When a user is composing a new message, let them pick the appropriate “From” address from a dropdown.  
3. The code that sends the message must use that specific address’s OAuth tokens so Gmail sends from the correct account.

---

## 8. Offline or Connection Interruptions

1. If the user is offline, disable the “Send” button or display a message indicating no network.  
2. Once they regain connectivity, let them proceed to send.  
3. No advanced local drafting is necessary unless you want to store partial content offline.

---

## 9. Thorough Verification and Safe Deployment

1. Start in a **development** or **staging** environment to make sure the new `ticket_email_chats` table is created and you can insert rows without affecting existing code.  
2. Connect a real Gmail account. Compose a message via the new interface. Verify it appears in that Gmail account’s **Sent** folder with the correct formatting and attachments.  
3. Send an email from an external address to the thread. Confirm it arrives in the chat interface once your logic (poll or push) syncs it into the `ticket_email_chats` table.  
4. Double-check that references to `comments` or other old structures are left intact so existing functionality is unaffected.  
5. Once everything looks correct, deploy to production.

---

## 10. Overall Summary of Steps

1. **Add the new Supabase table** `ticket_email_chats` with columns for message storage.
2. **Create the side panel** `<EmailThreadPanel>` that toggles in and out from the right.
3. **Load conversation data** from the new table, handle infinite scrolling if needed.
4. **Integrate a WYSIWYG editor** for basic Gmail-like formatting.
5. **Attach files** either by uploading to Supabase Storage or embedding them directly into the email send method.
6. **Send emails** using your Gmail API integration, inserting the new messages into `ticket_email_chats`.
7. **Receive and parse** new incoming emails. Insert them into `ticket_email_chats`, linking to the correct ticket.
8. **Allow multiple addresses** if needed, by storing multiple tokens or letting the user pick the “From” address.
9. **Handle offline** conditions gracefully by disabling the “Send” button when no connectivity is detected.
10. **Verify** the entire workflow in a safe environment. Confirm the user sees a smooth chat-like experience with real-time or near real-time updates.

**No step should be skipped.** Each section ensures that you maintain the existing system intact while adding this new functionality. Every detail—table structure, editor integration, file attachments, sending/receiving logic—should be set up carefully to avoid breaking current operations.

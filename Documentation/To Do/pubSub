1. Overview of Key Changes and Goals
	1.	Rebuild Pub/Sub:
	•	Create a new Pub/Sub topic dedicated to receiving Gmail push notifications.
	•	Securely configure a push subscription that sends messages to your Next.js webhook endpoint (/api/gmail/webhook).
	•	Validate that your webhook is receiving real messages from Google.
	2.	Replace customers Table Usage:
	•	Your schema uses profiles for storing user details (including customers, agents, and admins).
	•	All references to customers must be replaced with profiles (where role = 'customer') or simply profiles if searching by email.
	3.	Real-Time Notifications:
	•	Ensure Supabase real-time subscriptions on tickets, ticket_email_chats, or comments are set up to provide in-app notifications (toasts) when new messages or tickets appear.
	•	On the frontend, show a “You have new messages!” banner or toast.
	4.	Token Refresh & Management:
	•	Make sure your Gmail tokens (access and refresh) are properly stored in the profiles or organizations table.
	•	Add automated refresh logic to avoid expired tokens.
	•	Add CRON or fallback processes in case Pub/Sub fails.
	5.	Attachment Handling:
	•	Parse, store, and deliver attachments securely using Supabase storage with restricted policies.
	•	Limit file sizes, handle multiple MIME types safely.
	6.	Security & Compliance:
	•	Disable or carefully configure Row-Level Security (RLS) once you move from dev to production.
	•	Use environment variables for credentials.
	•	Provide appropriate logging, encryption, and role-based constraints on user actions.

2. Google Cloud Pub/Sub Setup

Below is a step-by-step plan for building a fresh Pub/Sub configuration in Google Cloud:
	1.	Create a New Topic
	1.	Go to the Google Cloud Console.
	2.	Navigate to “Pub/Sub” → “Topics.”
	3.	Click “Create Topic,” name it something like gmail-updates-<env> (e.g., gmail-updates-dev).
	4.	Leave defaults for region if you’re unsure, or pick a region near your server.
	2.	Create a Push Subscription
	1.	Under your newly created topic, click “Create Subscription.”
	2.	Provide a subscription name, e.g., gmail-updates-sub-dev.
	3.	Delivery Type: Choose “Push.”
	4.	Endpoint URL: Provide the secure HTTPS endpoint in your Next.js app, e.g.:

https://<your-domain>/api/gmail/webhook


	5.	Authentication: Enable OIDC Token or set a custom header token (discussed below). For high security, use OIDC or a verified domain.
	6.	Review optional configurations:
	•	Dead Letter Policy: Consider enabling so that unacked messages go to a DLQ for debugging.
	•	Ack Deadlines: 10 seconds to 60 seconds is typical; adjust as needed.

	3.	Add a Verification / Security Mechanism
	•	Option A: Use OIDC Token in your push subscription. Your Next.js webhook can verify the token in the Authorization header.
	•	Option B: Use a Secret Bearer Token. In your subscription config, set Authorization: Bearer <PUBSUB_SECRET_TOKEN>. Then in Next.js, compare req.headers.authorization to Bearer <PUBSUB_SECRET_TOKEN>.
	4.	Test the Pub/Sub Delivery
	•	Before hooking it fully into Gmail, use the “Publish Message” feature in the GCP console to send a sample message and verify your /api/gmail/webhook sees it.
	•	Check logs to confirm the message arrived.
	5.	Set Up Gmail Watch
	•	In your code (e.g., setupOrRefreshWatch or setupGmailWatch), pass the new topic’s name:

topicName: `projects/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>/topics/gmail-updates-<env>`


	•	Verify in the Google Cloud console that “Last push success” updates whenever new emails arrive.

3. Environment Variables and Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables exist in both development and production:
	•	Supabase

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>  # keep this server-side only


	•	Gmail OAuth

NEXT_PUBLIC_GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=<gmail-client-id>
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=<gmail-client-secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=<your-redirect-uri>


	•	Pub/Sub

GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=<your-gcp-project-id>
GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC=<new-topic-name>     # e.g. "projects/my-gcp-project/topics/gmail-updates-dev"
CRON_SECRET=<any-secret-string-for-cron>


	•	Webhook Secret (optional)

PUBSUB_SECRET_TOKEN=<random-generated-32-char-string>


	•	NODE_ENV
	•	Typically “development” or “production” as needed.

Recommended: Create .env.local for development, or set these in your hosting environment for production. Make sure sensitive fields are not prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if they must remain private on the server side.

4. Schema Alignment and Code Adjustments

4.1 Replace customers with profiles

Anywhere your code references a nonexistent customers table, switch to:

// Old (incorrect):
.from('customers')

// New (correct):
.from('profiles').eq('role', 'customer')
// or just .from('profiles') if searching by email

For example, if you had:

const { data: existingCustomer } = await supabase
  .from('customers')
  .select('*')
  .eq('email', senderEmail)
  .single();

Change it to:

const { data: existingProfile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('email', senderEmail)
  .single();

4.2 Ensure Table/Column Names Match
	•	For email logs, check that references to ticket_email_chats and email_logs in your code match the actual usage in the schema. You do have both ticket_email_chats and email_logs, so confirm which you want for storing inbound/outbound data.
	•	Validate columns like org_id, gmail_refresh_token, gmail_access_token exist in organizations or profiles.

4.3 Example Code Snippet

If your existing code does something like:

// Old snippet
if (!customerRecord) {
  await supabase.from('customers').insert({ ... });
}

Switch to:

// New snippet
if (!profileRecord) {
  await supabase.from('profiles').insert({
    id: userId,
    role: 'customer',
    email: senderEmail,
    org_id: someOrgId,
    ...
  });
}

5. Webhook Endpoint: /api/gmail/webhook

Your Next.js route (pages/api/gmail/webhook.ts) should:
	1.	Verify Authorization

const secretHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
if (!secretHeader || secretHeader !== `Bearer ${process.env.PUBSUB_SECRET_TOKEN}`) {
  res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  return;
}

Or use OIDC token verification if your subscription was set that way.

	2.	Parse Pub/Sub Message
	•	Extract messageId, historyId, emailAddress from the Pub/Sub data.
	•	If not provided, or if the message is invalid, log an error.
	3.	Fetch History or Poll
	•	Use the Gmail API to fetch new messages since the last known historyId, or fallback to a short poll if historyId is missing.
	4.	Parse and Upsert Tickets
	•	For each new or updated message, parse the from/to/subject/body.
	•	Check profiles for a matching email (from_address).
	•	Either create or update the existing ticket (matching on thread_id), then create a row in ticket_email_chats.
	5.	Acknowledge or Return
	•	Return a JSON response with success or error. Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges if the request is 2xx.

Important:
	•	Keep logs. If you store logs in audit_logs or logs, insert relevant details with level='error' or level='info' to troubleshoot easily.
	•	Handle duplicates gracefully: watch out for Pub/Sub message redelivery.

6. Automated Token Management (Gmail OAuth2)
	1.	User Authorization Flow
	•	You already have routes like /api/gmail/auth-url and /api/gmail/callback. Ensure the callback saves tokens to either profiles or organizations.
	2.	Auto-Refresh
	•	The google.auth.OAuth2 client can refresh tokens automatically if you call oauth2Client.refreshAccessToken().
	•	Update the stored tokens in Supabase.
	•	If a token refresh fails, log the error and possibly notify an admin.
	3.	Scheduled Watch Refresh
	•	Use your CRON job (gmail-watch-manager.ts or check-gmail-watches.ts) to refresh watch subscriptions before they expire.
	•	If watch creation fails, fallback to poll-based fetching every few minutes.
	4.	Vaulting / Encrypting
	•	For extra security, consider encrypting refresh tokens at rest.
	•	Alternatively, rely on Supabase’s built-in encryption if you trust the environment.

7. Real-Time Updates and Frontend Notifications
	1.	Supabase Subscriptions
	•	Subscribe to ticket_email_chats and tickets changes.
	•	On INSERT, show a toast that says “A new message arrived!” or “A new ticket was created!”
	•	The user can click the toast to open the relevant ticket or refresh the list.
	2.	State Management
	•	Option A: Use React Context.
	•	Option B: Use Redux or Zustand.
	•	Store your tickets in global state, update them when a subscription event arrives.
	3.	Toast Implementation
	•	The code you have (useToast, etc.) is sufficient. Just ensure subscription callbacks call toast(...).
	4.	Polling Fallback
	•	If you do not trust Pub/Sub or if tokens expire incorrectly, you can do periodic polling from the frontend or a server CRON job. But ideally, your Pub/Sub + Real-Time setup eliminates most manual refreshes.

8. Middleware and RBAC
	1.	Middleware
	•	middleware.ts: ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes and that roles match the route (/admin, /agent, /customer).
	2.	Role Enforcement
	•	Inside your Next.js / Supabase logic, confirm the user has role agent, admin, or super_admin for actions like updating other users’ tickets.
	3.	RLS for Production
	•	Once you’re stable, re-enable RLS on critical tables.
	•	Create policies that ensure org_id matches the user’s org_id to prevent data leaks.

9. Attachments and Secure Storage
	1.	File Ingestion
	•	Download attachments from Gmail (if part.filename && part.body.attachmentId).
	•	Store them in a Supabase storage bucket, e.g., attachments or re-use avatars if you prefer.
	•	Make sure you have a bucket policy that only allows access via signed URLs or for owners.
	2.	File Serving
	•	Provide signed URLs from your Next.js endpoints or use Supabase’s built-in URL signing.
	•	Time-limit them so that they expire quickly, minimizing unauthorized re-use.
	3.	Size & Type Limits
	•	Use MAX_FILE_SIZE checks in your code. Reject attachments above 5MB (or 10MB, etc.).
	•	Accept only known MIME types or validate them to avoid security issues with malicious attachments.

10. Testing & QA Strategy

10.1 Unit / Integration Tests
	•	Parsing Functions:
	•	Test parseGmailMessage with different email headers (including missing/invalid headers).
	•	Verify attachments are extracted correctly.
	•	Database Insertion:
	•	Mock Supabase calls.
	•	Check that “new email” → “insert into ticket_email_chats” or creates a new ticket with correct fields.

10.2 End-to-End Testing with Pub/Sub
	1.	Local Testing
	•	Use a local tool or the GCP console to publish a test message to your topic.
	•	Confirm the local endpoint receives it (requires a publicly accessible URL or an SSH tunnel like ngrok).
	2.	Production
	•	Send an actual email to your connected Gmail.
	•	Check GCP logs to see if the message was delivered to your subscription.
	•	Confirm logs in your Supabase logs or audit_logs table that an inbound message was processed.
	•	See if a new ticket or email chat row was created.

11. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerts
	1.	Supabase Logging
	•	Insert log rows on inbound email events (level: info, warn, or error).
	•	Use a structured format in JSON so you can filter logs easily.
	2.	Google Cloud Monitoring
	•	Track subscription metrics: unacked messages, push success rate, etc.
	•	Set up alerts if message acknowledgment drops or push errors spike.
	3.	External Tools (Optional)
	•	Sentry or Datadog for error tracing.
	•	LogRocket or FullStory for UI monitoring.

12. Deployment, Scaling & Future Enhancements
	1.	Dev vs. Prod
	•	Keep separate topics and separate environment variables.
	•	Example: GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC_DEV vs. GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC_PROD.
	2.	Scalability
	•	As ticket volume grows, you may want to enable more concurrency or usage of a job queue (like BullMQ) for message processing.
	3.	Security Hardening
	•	Re-enable Row-Level Security with appropriate policies once stable.
	•	Add encryption for fields like refresh_token.
	4.	Feature Extensions
	•	AI-based classification or auto-responses.
	•	Additional Slack or Teams notifications.
	•	Extended analytics on ticket resolution times.

Final Remarks
	•	Disable RLS for Development: As you stated, you can leave RLS disabled in dev. Just be sure to re-enable and create specific policies before going to production.
	•	Stay Consistent: Keep your environment variable usage, naming, and code references consistent so as not to mismatch them.
	•	Plan Thorough Testing: As soon as you have the new Pub/Sub up, do a round of integration tests. Try sending different types of emails (with attachments, HTML vs. plain text, etc.).

Following the plan above should give you a robust email-to-ticket system with secure, automatically refreshed tokens and real-time updates whenever a new message is received. If you encounter further issues, rely on the enhanced logging to pinpoint the exact failure stage—Pub/Sub subscription, webhook, Gmail API token refresh, or database insertion—and address accordingly.

Good luck rebuilding the Pub/Sub workflow and aligning everything with your Supabase schema! If you systematically follow each step, you’ll end up with a reliable, secure, and well-monitored Gmail integration that automatically creates and updates tickets in real time.

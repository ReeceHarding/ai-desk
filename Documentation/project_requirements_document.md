# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for FlowSupport

## Project Overview

FlowSupport is an AI-powered Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system akin to Zendesk, designed to streamline and automate support interactions for businesses of varying sizes—from startups to large enterprises. Leveraging advanced AI capabilities, FlowSupport minimizes manual workloads by efficiently routing and responding to customer inquiries. The platform intelligently manages customer interactions across various channels, including tickets, chats, and a comprehensive knowledge base, offering a seamless, cohesive user experience.

The primary purpose of building FlowSupport is to provide organizations with a modern, efficient CRM tool that reduces dependency on extensive support teams by utilizing AI for routine queries and knowledge base management. Key objectives include minimizing agent workload, providing robust multi-tenancy features, ensuring high scalability, and offering advanced analytics and security. Success will be measured by the system's ability to reduce manual intervention, improve ticket resolution times, and enhance overall customer satisfaction while maintaining high compliance and security standards.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

*   **AI Autoresponder & Chatbot**: Utilization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI-driven responses.
*   **Knowledge Base Management**: Article hosting with version control, localization, and multi-tenant accessibility.
*   **Org & Role Management**: Includes multi-tenancy and role-based access controls with row-level security.
*   **Collaboration Features**: Public/private comments and agent collaboration tools.
*   **Advanced Search**: Fuzzy text search and semantic search capabilities using TRGM and vector indexes.
*   **Reporting & Dashboards**: Analytics on ticket volumes, resolution times, and agent performance.
*   **Scalability and Custom Fields**: Support for JSONB fields and scalable architecture.
*   **Dark-themed UI**: Modern, responsive design compatible with desktop and mobile devices.

### Out-of-Scope

*   **Integration with External Platforms** beyond messaging services like email, text, and WhatsApp.
*   **Custom In-house Deployment Options** are not provided; the focus is on cloud-based solutions.
*   **Non-English Language Packs** beyond those initially supported in the platform's localization features.

## User Flow

A new user begins their journey on FlowSupport by engaging with an intuitive onboarding process. This tutorial guides them through setting up their organization, assigning roles, and configuring initial ticket workflows. With a single login, users can easily switch between different organizational accounts using the ‘Org Switcher’ feature. The home dashboard presents primary functionalities with clear access to ticket management and knowledge base articles.

Upon login, users interact via chat, email, or web forms, propelled by the AI-driven interface that showcases tickets and relevant knowledge base articles. The interface adheres to a dark-themed UI, characterized by a collapsible sidebar for navigation and a central content area displaying live tools and statistics. Users receive AI-suggested responses and direct links from the knowledge base, empowering efficient query resolution with minimum navigation.

## Core Features

*   **Authentication**: Secure multi-tenancy with roles such as customer, agent, admin, and super_admin.
*   **Automated RAG-Based Responses**: AI-powered responses via an integrated RAG approach.
*   **Dynamic Knowledge Base**: Supports article management with public/internal options.
*   **Team Collaboration**: Role and skills-based ticket assignments, comments, and private notes.
*   **Security & Access Control**: Robust role-based security with row-level privileges.
*   **AI Analytics & Dashboards**: Detailed performance insights and metrics tracking.
*   **Responsive Design**: A fluid and engaging UI that adjusts to user devices.
*   **Multiple Support Channels**: Integration with email, text, and WhatsApp for omnichannel interaction.

## Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**: likely based on a modern JavaScript framework, incorporating a sleek dark theme.
*   **Backend**: Built around an AI-driven RAG system, hosted on AWS with container orchestration.
*   **Database**: Supabase with JSONB fields and TRGM/vector embeddings for search functionalities.
*   **IDE**: Integration with the Cursor IDE for coding enhancements.
*   **Libraries**: GPT-based models like ChatGPT for AI functionalities.
*   **Integration**: Links to messaging platforms such as email providers, text, and WhatsApp.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Ensure low latency and high throughput for ticket processing and AI operations.
*   **Security**: Compliance with GDPR and SOC 2 Type II standards.
*   **Usability**: User-friendly experience with guided tutorials and straightforward navigation.
*   **Scalability**: Support high volumes of user interactions and ticket processing without degradation.

## Constraints & Assumptions

*   Good internet stability and connection are needed to leverage cloud-based processing effectively.
*   Reliability on the availability of GPT-based AI models for processing.
*   Assumption of existing knowledge base content for enabling RAG functionality.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**: Mitigate with optimized query frequencies and intelligent caching strategies.
*   **AI Model Availability**: Ensure redundancy in AI service providers to avoid single points of failure.
*   **Platform Restrictions**: Adherence to cloud-based and infrastructure policies will require strict checks.
*   **Data Integrity & Security**: Regular audits are essential to maintain compliance and prevent breaches.

This PRD establishes a comprehensive framework for the FlowSupport platform, aligning development efforts with initial specifications while providing clarity for future technical documentation efforts.

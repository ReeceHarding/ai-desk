I want you to read the Supabase file in order to understand our schema @20250123111534_schema.sql

You must be thorough and read every line of it and make sure our code calls it exactly like it should. 

Don't stop reading files until you've traced the entire call trace and understand everything that gets called from the frontend until the end of the chain when it returns something to the frontend

Mmake ell your documents work within [20250123111534_schema.sql](mdc:supabase/migrations/20250123111534_schema.sql) 

For each element I want you to write out what the schema is looking for and then what our code is actually calling and if these are different that make sure they're exactly the same and make sure everything we call in the code exists in the schema 

you must write out your chain of thought for all code you write

never enable RLS
